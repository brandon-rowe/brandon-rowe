## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm a passionate early internet enthusiast with a deep-rooted history in various online communities; contributing to the vibrant world of IRCs, BBS, P2P networking, torrenting and internet communication projects. My journey into the digital realm began in the early days of the internet where I witnessed and actively participated in its evolution while playing an active role in shaping and safeguarding its principles. I've learned so much from the internet that all I want to do is give back.

### 💻 My Development Journey

This experience ignited my curiosity and set me on a path of exploration in the vast world of coding and web development as well as my subsequent endeavors in internet security, encryption, and the development of privacy-centric tools and platforms.
