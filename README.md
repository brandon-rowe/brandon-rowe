# 👋 bonsoir, elliot

### 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm a passionate early internet enthusiast with a deep-rooted history in various online communities; contributing to the vibrant world of [IRCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), [BBSs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system), [P2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) networks, [torrenting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) and internet communication projects. My journey into the digital realm began in the early days of the internet where I participated in its evolution while playing an active role in shaping and safeguarding its principles. I've learned so much from the internet that all I want to do is give back.

### 💻 My Development Journey

I got my first taste of development during the Myspace era, where customization and personalization were the norm. This experience ignited my curiosity and set me on a path of exploration in the vast world of coding and web development. I would later find my way into subsequent endeavors in internet security, [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption), and the development of privacy-centric tools and platforms.

### 🏴‍☠️ Hacker & Hacktivist Days
Throughout my teens and twenties, I embraced the spirit of hacking and hacktivism, participating in various projects under different pseudonyms. I believed in the power of technology to bring about positive change and actively engaged in projects that aligned with my values. Millions have moved at my keystroke.

### 🔐 Advocacy for Internet Standards, Net Neutrality, and Security
I've devoted substantial time and effort to researching and contributing to internet standards, championing the cause of net neutrality, and advocating for robust internet security through encryption. I believe in a free, open, and secure internet; accessible to all.

### 🌐 Contributions to Privacy-Focused Apps
Under various pseudonyms, I've actively contributed to projects that prioritize online privacy. My involvement in the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) network, [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser, and [Signal](https://signal.org/) messenger apps reflects my commitment to creating tools that empower users with enhanced privacy and security.

### 📚 Research and Publications
I've delved into extensive research on internet security, encryption protocols, and privacy-enhancing technologies. Some of my research will be available soon once I organize everything into a digestable system.
